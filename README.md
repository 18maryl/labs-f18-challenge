ADI Labs Technical Challenge
===================

We're excited to see that you're interested in joining ADI Labs for the Fall 2018 semester! 

In Labs, we build products that are deployed and used by hundreds of students here at Columbia and beyond. To make sure you have enough technical experience to join the team, we've put together a quick technical challenge to assess your ability to use Flask, HTML/CSS, and Git/GitHub. 
This challenge should take about 30 minutes to complete and requires Python 3 (a minimal amount), a basic text editor (ex. Sublime or TextEdit), Git (pre-installed on most computers), and a GitHub account. Please complete this challenge on your own.

The Problem
-------------

ADI wants to showcase some of the awesome students here at Columbia. We want to make a webpage for each student with their name, their favorite picture, and their favorite color. However, the ADI committee has been procrastinating by watching the latest Black Mirror episodes and their other favorite shows on Netflix. 

That's where you come in; we need your help adding a page dedicated to you on our new showcase website. 

Task 1
-------------
Fork this repository.

Task 2
-------------
Create a new HTML page.
On this page, you must include at a minimum: your name, a picture of your favorite spot on campus, and a fun fact about yourself.
In addition, your website must incorporate some form of styling that makes it mobile-friendly. A standard toolkit for this is [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). The look of your site is up to you, but it should be clear and easy for a person to view.

Task 3
-------------
Extend the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/)  app so that going to the endpoint "/" + your uni will return the HTML page you created in task 2. (For example, if your uni was lcb50, you would make your HTML page visible at website.com/lcb50)

Task 4
-------------
Commit all of the changes you have made and push them to the fork of this repo you made on GitHub. Verify that your changes are visible.

Task 5
-------------
When you've completed the above steps, go to the link of your forked repo that shows all the requested changes. Copy that link into your ADI Labs application. Once you've successfully completed that, you're done. Thanks for completing the Labs Tech Challenge!
